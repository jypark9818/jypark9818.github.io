about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a 3rd year integrated M.S/Ph.D course student at Korea University. 
  I'm conducting research focusing on cost-efficient deep neural network (DNN) acceleration using tiered memory systems, neural processing unit (NPU) architectures, and memory systems for future datacenter servers.

        #    Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
