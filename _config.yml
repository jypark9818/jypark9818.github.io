about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a 3rd year integrated M.S/Ph.D course student at Korea University. 
  I'm conducting research focusing on cost-efficient deep neural network (DNN) acceleration using tiered memory systems, neural processing unit (NPU) architectures, and memory systems for future datacenter servers.

#I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
